## Overview

- **Course:** 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023  
- **Instructor:** Dr. Angela Yu  
- **Platform:** [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/)  
- **Goal:** To learn Python from basics to advanced topics through daily coding challenges and real-world projects.

This repo holds my personal solutions to the assignments and challenges, along with any additional notes or files I created while progressing through each day of the course.

## Course Structure

The course is broken down into 100 days (or modules) of lessons and projects. Each day covers specific topics, including but not limited to:

1. **Python Basics** (variables, data types, strings, conditionals, loops)  
2. **Data Structures** (lists, dictionaries, tuples)  
3. **Functions & Modules**  
4. **Object-Oriented Programming** (classes, objects, inheritance)  
5. **File Handling**  
6. **GUI Development** (Tkinter)  
7. **Web Scraping** (Beautiful Soup, Selenium)  
8. **Data Science** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)  
9. **API Interactions** (REST, JSON)  
10. **Automation Projects**  
11. **Game Development** (Turtle, PyGame)  
12. **Web Development** (Flask, Django Basics)  
13. **Database Integration** (SQLite, SQLAlchemy)  
14. **Deployment**

In this repository, you will find a folder for each day (`day_01`, `day_02`, etc.), which includes:

- **Code**: Python scripts or notebooks  
- **ReadMe/Notes**: Additional documentation or learning notes  
- **Project Files**: Assets or data relevant to the dayâ€™s project  

## Project List

Below is a short list of some of the main projects in this course:

- **Tip Calculator** â€“ Simple arithmetic and user input project  
- **Band Name Generator** â€“ First coding exercise that practices string manipulation  
- **Treasure Island** â€“ Basic text-based adventure game  
- **Rock-Paper-Scissors** â€“ Classic game focusing on conditionals  
- **Coffee Machine** â€“ OOP project simulating a coffee machine  
- **Pong Game** â€“ A classic arcade game built using Turtle graphics  
- **Snake Game** â€“ Another fun Turtle-based arcade game  
- **Flight Deal Finder** â€“ Web scraping and automation project  
- **Rain Alert** â€“ A project leveraging APIs to send weather alerts  
- **Blog with Flask** â€“ Basic blog website using Flask and Jinja templates  

*(These are just some highlights. The full repository contains daily exercises and additional smaller projects.)*

## Prerequisites

- **Python** (>=3.11 recommended)
